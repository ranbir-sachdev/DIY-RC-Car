# Arduino Bluetooth RC Car

# Project Overview

This project is an **Arduino-based Bluetooth-controlled car** designed to demonstrate the integration of hardware and software in building a basic remote-controlled system. It allows a user to control a two-motor vehicle wirelessly using a mobile phone via Bluetooth.

# Purpose & Goals

- **Hands-on learning** of electronics, motor drivers (L293D), and Arduino microcontroller programming.
- **Wireless communication** using the HC-05 Bluetooth module.
- **Circuit design practice** with breadboards, DC motors, and external power sources.
- **Software control** over hardware through Arduino code and serial communication.

# Key Features

- Dual DC motor control using L293D
- Bluetooth wireless communication (HC-05)
- Power management using 9V external battery
- Simple directional control (forward, reverse, left, right)

# Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- L293D Motor Driver
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- 2x DC Motors
- Breadboard + Jumper Wires
- 9V Battery with connector

# Control Method

The car receives directional commands (e.g., 'F', 'B', 'L', 'R', 'S') from a mobile Bluetooth terminal app and executes movement using PWM signals and digital control.
