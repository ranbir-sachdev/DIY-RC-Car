-Plugged the DC motors as outputs on the l298n motor driver (OUT1-OUT4). 
-Also hooked up the input wires on the l298n to the arduino digital pins so that I could control the motors.
-Removed the jumper caps on the ENA and ENB pins in order to control the speed of the motors. Then connected those pins to the arduino digital pins for control.
